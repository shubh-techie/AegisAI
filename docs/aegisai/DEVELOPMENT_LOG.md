# AegisAI Development Log

Record AegisAI work chronologically from 2026 onward. Distinguish observed work
from plans and experiments; do not backdate entries or invent intervening activity.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-001: Repository foundation

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** in the working tree; pending review and not committed.

- Verified status, branch, tags, and the last ten Git log entries before editing.
- Confirmed `feature/aegisai-foundation` and legacy tag at `b9518fa`.
- Removed the nine GloboTicket project directories and legacy solution from the
  current working tree; preserved historical commits and the legacy tag.
- Added AGENTS.md with identity, history, engineering, testing, security, and
  research-integrity rules.
- Established documentation, source, test, research, benchmark, deployment, and
  paper directories with `.gitkeep` placeholders where necessary.
- Updated README and history; aligned existing planning drafts with fresh
  implementation rather than reuse of the legacy application.
- Preserved existing .gitignore edits. No root LICENSE file was present.
- Validation: repository structure, local Markdown links, historical checkpoint
  recovery, `git diff --check`, `git status --short`, and `git diff --stat`.
- No executable tests run: no application, solution, or test suite exists yet.

**PLANNED**: .NET 8 implementation using Clean Architecture, SOLID, and tests.
**EXPERIMENTAL**: none executed; no results, benchmarks, or datasets produced.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-002: .NET 8 Clean Architecture foundation

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** in the working tree; pending review and not committed.

- Read AGENTS.md, project history, and this log before inspecting Git.
- Began from clean `feature/aegisai-foundation` at `d81b466`, the committed
  AEGISAI-001 foundation. The earlier entry records its status at task completion.
- Created AegisAI.sln with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Api projects
  plus Domain.Tests, Application.Tests, IntegrationTests, and ArchitectureTests.
- Targeted net8.0 with nullable reference types and implicit usings enabled;
  global.json selects SDK 8.0.204 with roll-forward within .NET 8 feature bands.
- Configured the requested inward project dependencies. No business logic added.
- Added only minimal API startup and GET /health returning HTTP 200 with
  {"status":"healthy"}; this is process liveness, not dependency readiness.
- Added SPEC-002 and ADR-001, updated README and current-state notices, and
  removed placeholders from directories that now contain real files.
- Validation on macOS arm64 with SDK 8.0.204: restore succeeded; build succeeded
  with zero warnings and zero errors; all six tests passed (four architecture,
  two integration), with zero failures and zero skipped tests.
- Domain and Application test projects intentionally contain no tests because
  their production projects contain no business behavior; the runner reports
  no available tests for these two assemblies.
- The initial sandbox restore stalled; it was stopped and restore/build/test
  succeeded with approved access for .NET tooling and NuGet.
- Historical commits and `securing-microservices-legacy` remain unchanged.
  No commit or push performed.

**PLANNED**: business behavior and its unit tests, infrastructure adapters,
authorization, risk assessment, telemetry, and deployment.
**EXPERIMENTAL**: none; no research results, benchmarks, or datasets produced.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-003: Research and system architecture

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** documentation in the working tree; pending review and
not committed. All described system extensions remain **PLANNED**.

- Read AGENTS.md and every existing docs/aegisai file before making changes.
- Began from clean `feature/aegisai-foundation` at `1714765`, the committed
  AEGISAI-002 foundation; retained the prior entries as historical task records.
- Added SPEC-003, System Architecture, Research Architecture, and Threat Model V1
  with Mermaid diagrams for request evaluation, project dependencies, experimental
  comparison, future behavioral analysis, and trust boundaries.
- Defined the full target flow, decision outcomes, enforcement obligations,
  evidence contracts, failure handling, and Clean Architecture responsibilities.
- Defined Models A–D and intended latency, throughput, FPR, FNR, risk classification,
  detection-time, and response-time measurements. Specified ground truth,
  denominators, unknown/not-applicable cases, censoring, and reproducibility.
- Separated future behavioral anomaly detection from the core request path and
  documented data/model integrity, privacy, and threats to experimental validity.
- Recorded planned threat controls, future verification, and residual risks;
  no controls are claimed implemented by this documentation task.
- Aligned existing target-architecture and research-scope summaries with the new
  documents; removed placeholders from the now-populated architecture and
  threat-model directories. Application source and tests are unchanged.
- Validation: dotnet test completed successfully with its normal restore/build
  steps; four architecture and two integration tests passed, zero failed/skipped.
  Domain/Application test projects still contain no cases, as previously documented.
- Local Markdown links, balanced code fences, Mermaid block presence, and
  git diff --check passed. Diagrams were inspected as source, not renderer-tested.
- HEAD and the legacy checkpoint remain unchanged; no commit or push performed.

**EXPERIMENTAL**: plans only. No experiments, research findings, benchmark values,
datasets, or citations were fabricated or produced.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-004: Authentication baseline

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** in working tree; pending review and not committed.

- Read AGENTS.md, System Architecture, SPEC-003, applicable ADRs, development log,
  and project history. Began from clean foundation branch at `060c5f5`.
- Added Application-owned ICurrentIdentity and issuer-qualified AuthenticatedIdentity
  without framework/provider dependencies; Domain and Infrastructure are unchanged.
- Added scoped HTTP identity mapping in Api, standard ASP.NET Core JWT bearer
  authentication, and an authenticated-user fallback policy. Health remains
  anonymous; GET /identity demonstrates the identity boundary.
- Enforced signature, issuer, audience, expiry/lifetime, and unique subject/issuer
  checks. Added HTTPS authority/audience configuration examples without secrets.
  An unconfigured host accepts no tokens; invalid partial configuration fails startup.
- Added SPEC-004 and ADR-002 and updated README and system implementation status.
- Added Application identity tests and real-handler JWT integration tests using
  temporary RSA signing keys. No test bypass or test key exists in production code.
- Validation: dotnet restore succeeded; dotnet build succeeded with zero warnings
  and zero errors; dotnet test passed 31 tests (7 Application, 20 integration,
  4 architecture), with zero failures/skips. Domain still has no behavior/tests.
- Documentation links and git diff --check passed. Git history and the legacy
  checkpoint are preserved; no commit or push performed.

**PLANNED**: live provider discovery/rotation tests, access-token profile and
assurance/revocation/replay decisions, deployment HTTPS, permission evaluation,
and audit. No RBAC, ABAC, or risk scoring was implemented.
**EXPERIMENTAL**: none; no research results or benchmarks produced.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-005: Model A RBAC baseline

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** experimental software in the working tree; pending review
and not committed. No research experiments or measurements were performed.

- Read AGENTS.md and relevant architecture, specifications, ADRs, project history,
  and development records. Began from clean foundation branch at `2ff024a`.
- Added Domain Subject, Role, Permission, Resource, and Action concepts and
  Application AuthorizationRequest and AuthorizationDecision contracts.
- Implemented IAuthorizationEngine with deterministic RBAC and ALLOW/DENY outcomes;
  exact resource/action matches, union of role grants, and default denial.
- Added a validated immutable versioned policy snapshot behind IRbacPolicyProvider
  and an in-memory Infrastructure adapter. Server configuration owns assignments;
  subjects are issuer-qualified, and absent policy grants nothing.
- Added authenticated POST /authorization/evaluate. Api maps transport/identity
  inputs; Application evaluates permissions. Requests cannot choose their subject
  or roles. Token role claims and spoofed headers do not grant permissions.
- Added SPEC-005 with assumptions, decision algorithm, configuration examples,
  HTTP semantics, limitations, and test scenarios; updated current summaries.
- Added Domain/Application unit tests and real JWT integration tests. Initial
  integration failures identified premature configuration capture; policy creation
  now follows finalized host configuration and validation precedes request serving.
- Final validation: dotnet build passed with zero warnings/errors; dotnet test
  passed all 72 tests (6 Domain, 21 Application, 41 integration, 4 architecture),
  zero failed/skipped. Local Markdown links and git diff --check passed.
- Preserved HEAD, historical commits, and securing-microservices-legacy.
  No commit or push performed.

**EXPERIMENTAL**: Model A software baseline only, without claimed research results.
**PLANNED**: resource enforcement, durable audit, research measurements, and Models
B–D. No ABAC, context evaluation, risk scoring, or behavioral AI was implemented.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-006: Model B attribute-based authorization

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** experimental software in working tree; pending review,
not committed. No research experiments or measurements were performed.

- Read AGENTS.md, RBAC/authentication specifications, applicable ADRs, and current
  implementation records. Began from clean foundation branch at `04b926f`.
- Added immutable attribute sets, scoped equality conditions, and resource/action
  targeted rules. Subject, resource, environment, and requested-action scopes are
  independently evaluated; all applicable conditions must pass.
- Added IAbacEvaluator and IAbacContextProvider plus Model B composition: RBAC
  must allow before ABAC executes; missing evidence or applicable rules deny.
- Added a trusted immutable Infrastructure snapshot with server-owned subject,
  resource, and environment fixtures. The action comes from the request. Snapshot
  validation happens before serving requests; no caller attributes are trusted.
- Added authenticated POST /authorization/evaluate/model-b with per-stage evidence
  and separate RBAC/ABAC versions; Model A's endpoint and algorithm are unchanged.
- Added SPEC-006, ADR-003, example configuration, and current-status documentation.
- Added independent unit tests and JWT integration comparisons for matching,
  mismatching, missing, and issuer-bound attributes; RBAC denial short-circuits ABAC.
- Fixed a type-inference compile error in new unit tests before final validation.
  Final dotnet build passed with zero warnings/errors. All 107 tests passed:
  12 Domain, 35 Application, 56 integration, and 4 architecture; zero failed/skipped.
- Local documentation links and git diff --check passed. HEAD and the historical
  legacy checkpoint remain unchanged; no commit or push performed.

**EXPERIMENTAL**: Models A/B software baselines only; representative test assertions
are not research outcomes. **PLANNED**: dynamic evidence with provenance/freshness,
resource enforcement, audit, measurement tooling, and Models C/D. No AI, behavioral
anomaly detection, or contextual risk scoring was implemented.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-007: Deterministic contextual risk

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** experimental Model C software in working tree; pending
review and not committed. No research runs or performance measurements performed.

- Read AGENTS.md, relevant authorization specifications and ADRs, system architecture,
  and existing implementation records. Began from clean branch at `f5965d7`.
- Added immutable normalized RiskContext and five explicitly simulated indicators;
  the fixed decimal weighted sum provides score, level, versions, and per-signal
  contributions/reasons. This is a deterministic heuristic, not AI or ML.
- Added Application risk/provider abstractions and Model C composition. RBAC/ABAC
  denial skips risk evaluation; missing indicators remain Unknown and force denial.
- Added ALLOW, DENY, STEP_UP, and LIMIT recommendations with explicit stronger-
  authentication/reevaluation or rate-cap obligations. No enforcement is claimed.
- Added trusted request-bound Infrastructure snapshots and authenticated
  POST /authorization/evaluate/model-c. Models A/B retain their behavior.
- Added SPEC-007, ADR-004, synthetic configuration examples, and current summaries.
- Tests cover levels, exact/below-threshold boundaries, normalized explanations,
  each missing signal, full missing context, invalid inputs, immutability, provider
  failure, baseline short-circuiting, four HTTP outcomes, and context binding.
- Integration tests caught null numeric configuration binding as zero. Replaced
  generic signal binding with explicit scalar parsing preserving unknown values;
  the regression test now passes.
- Final dotnet build passed with zero warnings/errors. All 140 tests passed:
  14 Domain, 53 Application, 69 integration, 4 architecture; zero failed/skipped.
- Local documentation links and git diff --check passed. HEAD and the historical
  legacy checkpoint are unchanged; no commit or push performed.

**EXPERIMENTAL**: hand-specified contextual risk software and synthetic fixtures;
no trained model, behavioral detection, measured assurance, or research findings.
**PLANNED**: verified live context, freshness/provenance, recent authorization
history if justified, challenge/rate enforcement, audit, and research measurements.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-008: Authorization audit and observability

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** best-effort observability in working tree; pending review
and not committed.

- Read AGENTS.md, system audit architecture, relevant authorization contracts,
  SPEC-007, and existing implementation records. Began from clean branch `57487e6`.
- Added Application audit event/sink contracts and API observation around the
  selected engine, producing one event per completed A/B/C HTTP evaluation.
- Recorded generated correlation/event IDs, trace IDs when available, SHA-256
  pseudonyms for subject/resource/action, model, decision, optional risk, reason
  codes, UTC timestamp, and monotonic engine duration. No tokens, credentials,
  attribute bags, raw identifiers, or exception messages enter these events.
- Added structured JSON console logging and .NET ActivitySource/Meter instrumentation
  compatible with OpenTelemetry collection. No exporter, Kafka, or external service
  was introduced. Metric dimensions are limited to model and decision.
- Isolated sink/observer failures from authorization results; engine errors propagate
  unchanged without fabricated decision events. Added a response correlation header.
- Created SPEC-008 describing contracts, data minimization, measurement boundaries,
  collection setup, exclusions, and the distinction from future durable audit.
- Final validation: dotnet build passed with zero warnings/errors; all 152 tests
  passed (14 Domain, 53 Application, 81 integration, 4 architecture), zero failed
  or skipped. Tests cover event correctness, real telemetry listeners, structured
  logger state, secret canaries, correlation, and failure isolation.
- Local documentation links and git diff --check passed. HEAD and the legacy
  checkpoint remain unchanged. No commit or push performed.

**PLANNED**: durable pre-action audit acceptance, authentication rejection audit,
protected operation outcomes, retention/access controls, and deployment exporters.
**EXPERIMENTAL**: authorization software only; no performance or research findings.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-009: Reproducible authorization experiment framework

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** experimental runner and generated synthetic smoke artifacts;
working tree pending review, not committed.

- Read AGENTS.md, Research Architecture, relevant A–C contracts and observability
  specification. Began from clean branch at `bdb9656`.
- Added net8.0 experiment console and test projects to the solution. The runner
  invokes real A/B/C engines using eight clearly labeled synthetic scenarios.
- Added seeded paired workloads, randomized model order, explicit warm-up and
  measured phases, raw tick observations, decision counts, latency percentiles,
  throughput, error accounting, environment metadata, and source/binary hashes.
- Added exact source archives for reproducing runs against uncommitted code.
  Model D remains PLANNED; future detection-quality interfaces have no implementation.
- Created SPEC-009 and research/README with executable reproduction commands and
  explicit exclusions: no HTTP, authentication, audit delivery, or enforcement timing.
- Release build passed with zero warnings/errors. All 156 tests passed (14 Domain,
  53 Application, 81 integration, 4 architecture, 4 experiment tests).
- Executed the Release smoke manifest separately after tests. Generated artifacts
  are in research/results/aegisai009-smoke: 2,400 measured calls per model, 600
  warm-up calls per model, 9,000 observations total, zero errors.
- Independently recomputed summary counts/latency values from raw observations and
  checked archived source hashes against the current source. No results were edited
  or invented. Actual measurements are in generated summary.json, not assumed here.
- Local Markdown links passed. The solution uses existing CRLF line endings;
  git -c core.whitespace=cr-at-eol diff --check passed without changing that source
  snapshot. Historical commits, HEAD, and securing-microservices-legacy are unchanged. No commit or push performed.

**EXPERIMENTAL**: tiny single-threaded synthetic engine-only smoke measurement;
aggregate measured windows were under 5 ms per model. No causal comparison,
production performance, representativeness, or security effectiveness is claimed.
**PLANNED**: Model D, independent detection labels, false-positive/negative analysis,
behavioral anomaly evaluation, and end-to-end measurements with durable audit.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-010: V0.1 development environment

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** workflow and experimental local fixtures; working tree
pending review, not committed. Docker runtime acceptance remains pending.

- Read AGENTS.md and reviewed task 001–009 specifications, architecture, ADRs,
  project history, development records, and implemented API/experiment contracts.
  Began from clean feature/aegisai-foundation at ecb9649.
- Added a non-root runtime Dockerfile, Compose API plus on-demand SDK/Git tools,
  build-context exclusions, isolated temporary build workspaces, and root ./dev
  commands for startup, health, A/B/C demo, logs, tests, experiments and shutdown.
- Added offline synthetic one-hour RS256 credentials with discarded private keys.
  The API receives only public trust, requires Development and exclusive local
  configuration, and keeps standard JWT checks. Domain/Application are unchanged.
  Added ADR-005 documenting the narrow local tooling exception to ADR-002.
- Added SPEC-010, concise Quick Start and V01_READINESS report; clarified current
  IMPLEMENTED/EXPERIMENTAL/PLANNED status and retained Model D as PLANNED.
- Included deployment C# projects in experiment archives so the expanded solution
  remains rebuildable from its recorded source snapshot. No secrets are archived.
- Initial local-trust integration test caught configuration read before test-host
  providers finalized; deferred option configuration and startup resolution fixed it.
  Final dotnet build passed with zero warnings/errors; all 168 tests passed:
  14 Domain, 53 Application, 93 integration, 4 architecture, 4 experiments.
- Actual local HTTP smoke passed health, anonymous rejection, A/B ALLOW, C STEP_UP
  at score 0.300 and forbidden-write DENY. Verified four audit events/correlation
  IDs and absence of the generated token in captured logs. Stopped the temporary API.
- Docker/Compose clients exist and Compose/shell syntax validation passed. Attempted
  Docker build; the daemon socket was absent, so no container build/startup success
  is claimed. The readiness report explicitly tracks this validation gap.
- Ran a separate executable local Release smoke experiment under
  research/results/aegisai010-local-smoke; actual generated artifacts are retained.
  This is synthetic execution validation, not a performance claim.
- Verified 9,000 raw observations, 2,400 measured decisions per model with zero
  errors, and exact source archive contents including DevTools and excluding local
  credentials. Local Markdown links, shell/Compose syntax, and CRLF-aware diff
  whitespace validation passed; HEAD and the legacy checkpoint remain unchanged.
- No commit, push, historical rewrite, or legacy tag change performed.

**PLANNED**: container runtime acceptance, production provider/context integration,
protected-operation enforcement, durable audit and behavioral AI/ML.
**EXPERIMENTAL**: local synthetic authorization exploration and engine-only smoke.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-011: GitHub CI and repository security baseline

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** in working tree; pending review, not committed.

- Read AGENTS.md and all existing AegisAI Markdown documentation. Began from clean
  docs/aegisai-research-architecture at f73d1aa; legacy checkpoint resolves to b9518fa.
- Added .github/workflows/ci.yml for pull requests targeting main, with checkout,
  .NET 8 setup, solution restore, Release build and all tests. Failures propagate;
  no path/test filters or failure suppression are configured.
- Granted contents: read only, disabled checkout credential persistence, pinned
  both official actions to verified full hashes, and used a hosted runner with a
  20-minute timeout. No repository secrets or deployment access are requested.
- Reviewed ignore rules, solution/project configuration, example settings, Docker
  files, development scripts, and credential generation. Current tracked-text
  credential-pattern scan and sensitive-filename check found no matches.
- Added missing JWK and named secrets JSON exclusions to .dockerignore; existing
  .gitignore already covers these. Verified twelve representative ignored paths.
- Recorded remaining limits: historical credential rotation is unverified, tools
  bind mounts can read local files, images are mutable and dependencies unlocked.
  History/archives/ignored contents and hosted security settings were not scanned.
- Added [SPEC-011](specs/SPEC-011-CI-SECURITY.md) with workflow semantics, review
  scope, security observations, actual validation, and hosted execution limits.
- Local macOS arm64 SDK 8.0.204 restore and Release build succeeded with zero
  warnings/errors; all 168 tests passed (14 Domain, 53 Application, 93 integration,
  4 architecture, 4 experiments), zero failed/skipped. Used single-node MSBuild
  with node reuse disabled. Stopped a stalled sandbox restore; approved access
  allowed the equivalent restore/build/test sequence to complete.
- Workflow YAML/structural assertions, shell syntax, Compose configuration,
  Markdown links, and diff whitespace checks passed. actionlint was unavailable;
  GitHub-hosted execution has not run. No application source or test changes.
- Preserved HEAD and securing-microservices-legacy; no commit or push performed.

**PLANNED**: hosted PR validation, owner-managed merge/security settings, and
confirmation of historical credential revocation. **EXPERIMENTAL**: no new runs.

## 2026-09-23 — AEGISAI-011-FINAL: CI/security verification and review readiness

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** final changes in working tree; pending review, not committed.

- Read AGENTS.md, development log, SPEC-011, and CI before inspecting status,
  branch, and the last ten commits. Started on ci/github-actions at 3b98497.
  Preserved the pre-existing untracked research/results/local-validation/ directory.
- Established CI coverage for both pull requests targeting main and pushes to main.
  Retained checkout, .NET 8, restore, Release build, all tests, failure propagation,
  contents: read only, and disabled credential persistence. Switched official
  actions to checkout@v6 and setup-dotnet@v5 per the requested major-pin preference;
  documented their mutable-tag limitation. No third-party action or secrets added.
- Executed dotnet restore, dotnet build --configuration Release, and dotnet test
  --configuration Release on macOS arm64, SDK 8.0.204. Restore and build passed,
  zero build warnings/errors; 168 tests executed and passed, zero failed/skipped:
  14 Domain, 53 Application, 93 integration, 4 architecture, 4 experiments.
  Passing invalid-request tests emitted BadHttpRequestException developer error
  logs; local Data Protection informational logs noted unencrypted profile storage.
- Recorded user-observed Docker startup, ASP.NET Core listening on 8080, and
  GET /health HTTP 200. A fresh ./dev health succeeded with healthy JSON. Tools
  emitted a workload-verification warning; it did not block the health check.
  Optional demo and ci-validation experiment were not rerun.
- Recorded user-observed ephemeral/in-memory Data Protection warnings as a V0.1
  development limitation: no durable key store is configured, so dependent
  protected payloads may not survive restarts. No production-readiness claim.
- Scanned 258 tracked text files/archive members for obvious credential patterns:
  zero candidates. Verified root/nested .env, .env.*, .idea/, .DS_Store, bin/, obj/
  exclusion and .env.example inclusion. No .gitignore change required. Historical
  credential revocation remains unverified; no full-history audit was performed.
- Reviewed research claims: A/B/C supporting code is IMPLEMENTED, behavioral/AI
  Model D is PLANNED, and runner/synthetic artifacts are EXPERIMENTAL. No unsupported
  superiority, independent adoption, or production-readiness claim was found.
  Corrected stale no-results statements in research/architecture summaries and
  labeled the migration plan as a historical snapshot. Updated V01_READINESS and
  SPEC-011 with current CI, local validation, Docker evidence, and limitations.
- Workflow structure, ignore checks, local documentation links/fences, shell/Compose
  syntax, and git diff --check passed. Hosted execution of the updated CI and
  repository merge/security settings were not verified; actionlint unavailable.
- No application behavior changed. No commit, push, merge, rebase, history rewrite,
  branch deletion, or legacy-tag change performed; main remains unchanged.

**PLANNED**: hosted CI observation, owner-managed required checks/security settings,
historical credential revocation confirmation, production key management.
**EXPERIMENTAL**: existing framework/artifacts only; no new research run in this task.

## 2026-09-25 — AEGISAI-012: Research Definition and Hypothesis Baseline

Status: **IMPLEMENTED** research-definition documentation in working tree;
pending review, not committed. Model D remains **PLANNED RESEARCH**.

- Read AGENTS.md, development log, project history, research/system architecture,
  relevant specifications/ADRs, Models A–C and the experiment framework; inspected
  status, branch and Git history before editing. Started from clean ci/github-actions
  at 98572c0; created research/aegisai-research-definition from that commit because
  the requested branch did not exist locally. No edits were made on main.
- Established the umbrella AI-Driven Automation for Resilient & Secure
  Cloud/Distributed Systems, with AegisAI as its experimental platform and
  explainable, policy-bounded, adaptive security as its research focus.
- Added eleven documents under research/ within docs/aegisai: research problem,
  primary question/RQ1–RQ4, Models A–D definitions, H1–H4, proposed contribution,
  conceptual model, variables/metrics, claims register, invention candidates,
  research-program relationship and research-integrity requirements.
- Defined H1 behavioral effectiveness, H2 policy-bounded safety, H3 operational
  resilience and H4 performance trade-off as unproven. Recorded independent-label,
  comparator/ablation, metric-definition and pre-experiment threshold requirements.
  Blast-radius meaning and acceptable performance thresholds remain unresolved.
- Recorded no invention/novelty claim for RBAC, ABAC, Zero Trust, risk-based
  authorization, anomaly detection, ML, autonomous incident response or feedback.
  The working invention title and five mechanisms are candidates only; prior-art
  and patent-counsel reviews have not established novelty or patentability.
- Corrected the conflicting earlier Model D scorer-replacement definition in the
  research architecture and SPEC-003, explicitly recording its supersession.
  Aligned Research Scope and linked the baseline/claims register from README.
- Corrected the threat model's stale health-only implementation statement and
  qualified SPEC-003/005/006/007 status statements as historical task scopes.
  Current code has A–C and a synthetic engine-only runner, not behavioral detection,
  operational-state ingestion, protected-operation enforcement or a feedback loop.
  STEP_UP/LIMIT remain recommendations with obligations; C's inputs are simulated.
- Validation on macOS arm64, .NET SDK 8.0.204: dotnet restore passed; dotnet build
  --configuration Release passed with zero warnings/errors; dotnet test
  --configuration Release passed all 168 tests (14 Domain, 53 Application,
  93 integration/security, 4 architecture, 4 experiments), zero failed/skipped.
  A sandbox restore stalled and was terminated; the exact required commands then
  completed with approved tooling access. Integration output included the existing
  local Data Protection profile-storage informational messages.
- Documentation validation passed: required files, RQ/H headings, claims-table
  structure, local Markdown link targets, code fences and whitespace. Mermaid was
  inspected as source, not renderer-tested. Final status, diff stat and diff check
  were reviewed; untracked new documents were checked separately because ordinary
  git diff does not include them.
- Application source, tests, experiment configuration and results are unchanged.
  HEAD remains 98572c0, main remains 3b98497, and the legacy tag still resolves to
  b9518fa. No commit, push, merge, rebase, historical rewrite or tag change.

**EXPERIMENTAL**: existing synthetic A–C artifacts only; no new research run or
experimental validation of H1–H4. **PLANNED**: precise confirmatory protocols,
literature/prior-art review, Model D and evaluation of the proposed contribution.
